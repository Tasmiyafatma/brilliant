Boris cannot be third. If there were two runners between Carlos and amelia, one must be in first and the other fourth,. Since we have rulked out Amelia being in first, Amelia must be in fourth and Carlos must be in first. This leaves only Boris and Dara. Since Boris cannot be in third, he must be second, and that leaves Dara in third."

        report: "Since Dara finished before Amelia that means that Dara is in front of Amelia. Boris can't be third so he could be 4th, which leaves Carlos at the last. But wait, that doesn't match the last statement. Since there were 2 runners between Amelia and Carlos and there are 4 runners, either Amelia is in the first, which can't be possible since Dara finished before Amelia, or Carlos is first. So poor Amelia was last, leaving Dara right in front of her and Boris after. So the final results match properly: 1st. Carlos 2nd. Boris 3rd. Dara 4th. Amelia."

We know that someone has finished before Amelia, therefore she is not first, therefore by what we already know, she is last. So Carlos has to be first. Clue 2. Is useless relative to the question."
